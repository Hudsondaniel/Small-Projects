    <h1><strong>Orecchiette recipe</strong></h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients<br></h2>
    <ul> <h3>For the base<br></h3>
         <li> 300g strong bread flour<br></li>
            <li>tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)<br></li>
            <li>tsp salt<br></li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
        <h3>For the tomato sauce</h3>
        <li>100ml passata<br></li>
           <li> handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried<br></li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <h3>To finish</h3>
        <li> handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol><h3><li>STEP</h3>
        <p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p></li>
        <h3><li>STEP</h3>
            <p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p></li>
        <h3><li>STEP</h3>
            <p>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p></li>
            <h3><li>STEP</h3>
            <p>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p></li></ol>
