    <h1><strong>Orecchiette recipe</strong></h1>
    <img src="/home/hudson/The-odin-project/odin-Recipies/images/pizza.jpg" alt="Orecchiette"><br>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pasta that has a shape resembling an ear, hence the name, meaning "little ear" in Italian. The pasta is about 3/4 of an inch wide and dome shaped, with the middle being thinner than the outer edges. The difference in thickness gives it a texture that varies from soft in the middle to chewy on the outer edges.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients<br></h2>
    <ul> 
         <li> 400g orecchiette<br></li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil, 2 red chillies, deseeded and finely chopped<br></li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed<br></li>
            <li>400g can butter beans, drained and rinsed</li>
       
        <li>400g can cherry tomatoes<br></li>
           <li> 1 lemon, zested and juiced<br></li>
            <li>1Â½ large bunch of parsley, finely chopped<br></li>
        <li> 25g grated parmesan or vegetarian alternative </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol><h3><li>STEP</h3>
        <p>Cook the orecchiette following pack instructions until al dente, about 10 mins. Drain, reserving the cooking water.
        </p></li>
        <h3><li>STEP</h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and fry the chillies and garlic for 2 mins until just softened. Mix in the butter beans, tomatoes, lemon zest and juice. Cook for 5 mins more, then scatter in the parsley and cook for another 2 mins. The tomatoes should have reduced slightly and the beans should be warmed through.</p></li>
        <h3><li>STEP</h3>
            <p>Tip the orecchiette into the frying pan with the butter bean mixture. Pour in a little of the reserved pasta cooking water if you prefer a looser sauce. Spoon into bowls and sprinkle with the cheese before serving, if you like.</p></li>
